The aim of the thesis was to create a service that allows playing Rummikub between players or between a player and a bot. An Android phone app has been created, as well as a browser-based website. Moreover, an algorithm for the bot was described along with complexity analysis. Flutter and Firebase technologies were used during the implementation of the service. Flutter is a technology that allows projects to be created simultaneously for different platforms. Firebase offers server services for the project.
